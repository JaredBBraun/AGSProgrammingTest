ASP Programming Test

-Used Model View Controller as coding architecture to separate user (view) and control logic (model)
-Created WebGL build to run locally
  -Use command in powershell `py -m http.server` in `AGSProgrammingTest\Builds\WebGL`  to run a python server to serve the WebGL locally over local host, 
  which you can run in most browsers (I tested it locally with Chrome)
